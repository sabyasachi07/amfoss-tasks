Introspection
Why must we choose you?

The day I started contributing to open source org.,I want to dig deeper to know how the system works.As I am curious and want to stay updated about on-going developements.

How were you before joining and how are you now

I am good, Have a great day for you too.Hope i will learn new things from completing tasks.I want to contribute to projects as this suits to me So I give my time contributing for this.

What are your comments and suggestions regarding the selection process

This is fine for me. First it is free,Second candidates are selected without any competition which helps more and more coders to take part in it.
What is your plan for the next 6 months?

Will not stop contributing to open source projects and working in big organizations like vlc, kde etc.
How would you contribute back to the club?
